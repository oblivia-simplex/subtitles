1
00:00:19,012 --> 00:00:21,879
"This film was named by
the Council of Ministers of
the Department of Entertainment...

2
00:00:22,015 --> 00:00:24,984
...as being a 'Film of National
Cultural Interest'."

3
00:00:39,032 --> 00:00:42,001
YOU LAUGH

4
00:00:51,044 --> 00:00:53,012
First Story:
"FELICE"

5
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:16,969
Second Story:
"TWO ABDUCTIONS"

6
00:03:21,995 --> 00:03:23,860
His name is "Felice".

7
00:03:23,997 --> 00:03:26,864
"Happy" in name,
unhappy in fact.

8
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:30,868
Unhappy ever since, as a
young, up and coming baritone

9
00:03:31,004 --> 00:03:35,873
...a heart condition forced
him to step down from the stage.

10
00:03:36,009 --> 00:03:39,968
He still worked in the theatre,
but as an accountant.

11
00:03:47,020 --> 00:03:48,885
Unhappy, too,
was Marika.

12
00:03:49,022 --> 00:03:51,889
She had admired him
in the Sofia Theatre.

13
00:03:52,025 --> 00:03:54,892
She'd followed him,
and, eventually, married him.

14
00:03:55,028 --> 00:03:58,896
She now lives with a husband
who's no longer a baritone

15
00:03:59,032 --> 00:04:01,933
...beneath a sky that's
no longer her own.

16
00:04:05,971 --> 00:04:07,939
You're laughing.

17
00:04:08,975 --> 00:04:11,944
- Just now?
- Just now.

18
00:04:16,983 --> 00:04:19,850
Listen...
are you sure, Marika?

19
00:04:19,986 --> 00:04:22,853
My stomach was just
making noises.

20
00:04:22,989 --> 00:04:26,857
Yeah, that's it.
Listen!

21
00:04:26,993 --> 00:04:30,861
It was something like that,
and you thought I was laughing.

22
00:04:30,997 --> 00:04:34,956
No, you were laughing.
You want to know how? Like this:

23
00:04:38,004 --> 00:04:39,972
Like that?

24
00:04:42,008 --> 00:04:43,873
Why were you laughing?

25
00:04:44,010 --> 00:04:45,978
I don't know.

26
00:04:48,014 --> 00:04:49,982
- I know why.
- Yeah?

27
00:04:52,018 --> 00:04:55,886
You only laugh like that
when you're making love.

28
00:04:56,022 --> 00:04:58,891
- Who were you making love to
tonight?

29
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:02,500
I wasn't dreaming.
I never dream.

30
00:05:02,500 --> 00:05:05,000
I'd like to crack that knot
of yours open and see inside.

31
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:06,830
What do you think I have
in my head, in this...

32
00:05:06,966 --> 00:05:08,934
"knot" like you call it?

33
00:05:10,970 --> 00:05:12,938
I'm nothing anymore.

34
00:05:19,979 --> 00:05:21,844
What if I were to kiss you...

35
00:05:21,981 --> 00:05:23,949
like this...

36
00:05:31,991 --> 00:05:33,856
You're not jealous.

37
00:05:33,993 --> 00:05:35,961
You hate me.

38
00:05:37,997 --> 00:05:39,965
Where are you going now?

39
00:05:43,002 --> 00:05:44,970
You should take your drops.

40
00:05:47,006 --> 00:05:49,873
You're fussing over your
hair in the middle of the night,

41
00:05:50,009 --> 00:05:53,877
while I'm over here going crazy.

42
00:05:54,013 --> 00:05:55,981
You are going crazy.

43
00:06:06,959 --> 00:06:10,827
At the bottom of the sea...

44
00:06:10,963 --> 00:06:14,831
- Viva!
- Thank you!

45
00:06:14,967 --> 00:06:17,936
- Viva!
- Such an honour!

46
00:06:21,974 --> 00:06:24,841
Now here comes my niece!

47
00:06:24,977 --> 00:06:27,844
Here comes my niece,
I must present myself.

48
00:06:27,980 --> 00:06:29,845
- Viva!
- Thank you!

49
00:06:29,982 --> 00:06:32,849
Here comes my niece,
I must present myself.

50
00:06:32,985 --> 00:06:34,850
I must present myself.

51
00:06:34,987 --> 00:06:37,854
I must present myself.

52
00:07:01,013 --> 00:07:04,813
Felice! You look tired.
What are you doing at night?
You're not sleeping?

53
00:07:04,951 --> 00:07:06,816
I don't sleep.

54
00:07:06,953 --> 00:07:08,921
You don't do shit.

55
00:07:32,979 --> 00:07:36,847
- You two are moving like tortoises.
- Morning, Sir.

56
00:07:36,983 --> 00:07:38,951
Tespini, what nerve.

57
00:07:55,001 --> 00:07:56,866
No, not again...

58
00:07:57,003 --> 00:07:58,971
Again, this morning.

59
00:08:08,948 --> 00:08:11,815
I'm sorry. Excuse me.

60
00:08:11,951 --> 00:08:15,819
- The cane.
- I don't have it...
- That guy's got it.

61
00:08:15,955 --> 00:08:17,923
- The cane.
- Give it to me.

62
00:08:19,959 --> 00:08:22,928
Please excuse these two klutzes.

63
00:08:26,966 --> 00:08:28,934
What are you laughing about?

64
00:08:47,987 --> 00:08:49,955
I'll kill him.

65
00:08:51,991 --> 00:08:53,856
One of these days,
I'll kill him.

66
00:08:56,996 --> 00:09:00,955
At least I've got you to
make me laugh.

67
00:09:02,935 --> 00:09:05,904
I don't really feel like
it this morning.

68
00:09:10,943 --> 00:09:12,808
Tobia...

69
00:09:12,945 --> 00:09:15,914
It happened again, last night.

70
00:09:17,950 --> 00:09:19,815
You were laughing, again?

71
00:09:19,952 --> 00:09:25,822
If you want to dance, Mr Conde...

72
00:09:25,958 --> 00:09:30,827
If you want to dance, Mr Conde...

73
00:09:30,963 --> 00:09:35,832
I shall play the guitar...

74
00:09:35,968 --> 00:09:40,837
Yes, I shall play the guitar.

75
00:09:40,973 --> 00:09:43,840
Yes, I shall play it.

76
00:09:43,976 --> 00:09:45,944
I shall play it.

77
00:09:57,990 --> 00:09:59,859
You're sleeping.

78
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:03,000
You're sleeping.
Are you dreaming?

79
00:10:03,100 --> 00:10:05,964
How much sleep did you
get last night?

80
00:10:11,003 --> 00:10:13,870
"Fa" natural,
it's not a sharp.

81
00:10:14,006 --> 00:10:15,974
"Fa" natural.

82
00:10:19,011 --> 00:10:20,979
Shut those doors.

83
00:12:10,990 --> 00:12:15,859
Yes, I shall play the guitar.

84
00:12:15,995 --> 00:12:17,860
Yes, I shall play it.

85
00:12:17,997 --> 00:12:20,864
I shall play it.

86
00:12:20,997 --> 00:12:22,000
No.

87
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:22,865
That's a bit too bright.

88
00:12:23,002 --> 00:12:26,870
Figaro seems happy,
but he's not.

89
00:12:27,006 --> 00:12:29,873
He wants to go to bed with
that woman.

90
00:12:30,009 --> 00:12:32,978
That "Fa" natural...

91
00:12:35,014 --> 00:12:36,879
...it's almost sinister,
a challenge.

92
00:12:37,016 --> 00:12:39,985
He wants revenge.

93
00:12:45,024 --> 00:12:46,889
Excuse me.

94
00:12:47,026 --> 00:12:51,895
This is weird. I'm singing
the way you told me to, yesterday.

95
00:12:52,031 --> 00:12:54,898
You were there, too, right?
"Ironic, lively!"

96
00:12:55,034 --> 00:12:57,902
And today, you want the opposite.
Explain this to me.

97
00:12:58,000 --> 00:12:59,000
No, I know.

98
00:12:59,038 --> 00:13:03,839
Sometimes Mozart is clear to me.
Sometimes, he's incomprehensible.

99
00:13:03,976 --> 00:13:07,844
It's white, but if you
read between the notes...

100
00:13:07,980 --> 00:13:09,845
...it's black, it's green.

101
00:13:09,982 --> 00:13:13,941
If you're still making sense of it,
I'll come back tomorrow.

102
00:13:18,991 --> 00:13:21,300
I'm searching for truth.

103
00:13:21,400 --> 00:13:23,962
And you must help me find her.

104
00:13:31,003 --> 00:13:33,972
- Is this an open rehearsal?
- Who's there?

105
00:13:39,011 --> 00:13:40,876
It was me. Excuse me.

106
00:13:41,013 --> 00:13:45,882
- "Me"? Who's "me"?
- One of our musicians?

107
00:13:46,018 --> 00:13:48,987
Are you one of our musicians?
Answer me.

108
00:13:51,023 --> 00:13:53,992
- No.
- Are you a singer?

109
00:13:58,030 --> 00:14:02,831
No.
I'm an accountant for the theatre.

110
00:14:02,968 --> 00:14:07,837
Tespini, we each have our job to do.
Go back to your office.

111
00:14:07,973 --> 00:14:09,941
Back to your office.

112
00:14:16,982 --> 00:14:22,852
If you want to dance, Mr Conde...

113
00:14:22,988 --> 00:14:27,857
If you want to dance, Mr Conde...

114
00:14:27,993 --> 00:14:32,953
I shall play the guitar.

115
00:14:46,011 --> 00:14:47,876
It's just a bit of bronchitis.

116
00:14:48,013 --> 00:14:50,880
But you're not a rock, you know.

117
00:14:52,280 --> 00:14:54,018
Cover yourself up when it rains.

118
00:14:54,019 --> 00:14:59,250
You seem rather tense.
Are you sleeping well at night?

119
00:14:59,251 --> 00:15:02,824
That's actually why I'm here,
not the bronchitis.

120
00:15:02,962 --> 00:15:04,930
Insomnia?

121
00:15:06,966 --> 00:15:08,934
Let me explain...

122
00:15:13,973 --> 00:15:16,840
Excuse me, but when you were
in medical school...

123
00:15:16,976 --> 00:15:18,841
...did you also study psychiatry?

124
00:15:18,978 --> 00:15:23,000
It was as an elective,
but yes, I did. Why?

125
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:24,846
Good grades?

126
00:15:24,983 --> 00:15:27,851
The only class I passed with
distinction. I had a knack.

127
00:15:27,987 --> 00:15:30,854
But, here I am.

128
00:15:30,990 --> 00:15:33,858
But in life, it's one thing to
aspire to something...

129
00:15:33,990 --> 00:15:34,858
...and another to do it.

130
00:15:34,994 --> 00:15:38,863
But you know what I mean,
don't you, Felice?

131
00:15:38,864 --> 00:15:39,998
Of course.

132
00:15:39,999 --> 00:15:42,866
I'm the most unfortunate
of baritones...

133
00:15:43,002 --> 00:15:45,869
...the most unhappy husband,
the worst employee...

134
00:15:46,005 --> 00:15:49,873
...and I laugh through the night.
Tell me, doctor, am I crazy?

135
00:15:50,009 --> 00:15:52,876
You laugh?
In what way?

136
00:15:53,012 --> 00:15:57,881
- Doctor, may I come in?
- Just a moment, please be patient.

137
00:15:58,017 --> 00:16:00,884
So, you laugh.

138
00:16:01,020 --> 00:16:02,920
I laugh.

139
00:16:05,958 --> 00:16:07,823
I laugh! Like this!

140
00:16:07,960 --> 00:16:11,828
A big, long, cheerful laugh!
That's what they tell me.

141
00:16:11,964 --> 00:16:15,923
Doctor, is it possible to laugh
in your sleep without knowing it?

142
00:16:17,970 --> 00:16:22,838
There are various methods
for interpreting dreams.

143
00:16:23,974 --> 00:16:24,841
No, I don't dream.
I never dream.

144
00:16:24,977 --> 00:16:27,844
That's what you think,
but you do dream.

145
00:16:27,980 --> 00:16:30,847
You don't remember them
because they weigh on you.

146
00:16:30,983 --> 00:16:33,850
Like dark, black lead?

147
00:16:33,986 --> 00:16:35,954
But you dream.

148
00:16:37,990 --> 00:16:41,858
So, I laugh at the dreams
that I'm having.

149
00:16:41,994 --> 00:16:45,862
Yes, they're pleasant dreams.
Maybe you have them often.

150
00:16:45,998 --> 00:16:47,966
And that's why you laugh.

151
00:16:53,005 --> 00:16:55,872
I don't have any happiness in my life.
I have nothing to laugh at.

152
00:16:56,008 --> 00:16:57,873
Be patient!
Just a moment!

153
00:16:58,010 --> 00:17:00,877
It's a compensation.

154
00:17:01,013 --> 00:17:02,913
Nature comes to your
aid in dreams.

155
00:17:04,950 --> 00:17:09,819
In dreams, you're freed from
your miseries, your agonies...

156
00:17:09,955 --> 00:17:12,822
...and carried lightly, like a
feather...

157
00:17:12,958 --> 00:17:15,825
...through happy and pleasant
dreams.

158
00:17:15,961 --> 00:17:17,826
How do you like that?

159
00:17:17,963 --> 00:17:20,830
I've turned evil.
My wife is sure of it.

160
00:17:20,966 --> 00:17:23,833
Because you are clearly,
fundamentally good.

161
00:17:23,969 --> 00:17:28,000
If you can't be good during the day,
you are at night, when you dream...

162
00:17:28,001 --> 00:17:29,838
...and laugh.

163
00:17:29,975 --> 00:17:31,840
What a shame!

164
00:17:31,977 --> 00:17:36,937
To be happy in dreams,
without knowing it.

165
00:17:38,984 --> 00:17:40,849
Felice, come and see this.

166
00:17:40,986 --> 00:17:44,945
It was raining earlier.
But look at it now!

167
00:18:04,943 --> 00:18:07,810
You don't sleep in this bed
anymore. You're not going to
share it with your women!

168
00:18:07,946 --> 00:18:10,813
It's not like that!
The doctor explained everything.

169
00:18:10,949 --> 00:18:13,816
I dream of innocent things.

170
00:18:13,952 --> 00:18:15,817
The doctor knows nothing!

171
00:18:15,954 --> 00:18:18,821
Listen, Marika. Wait!

172
00:18:18,957 --> 00:18:21,824
I want you to suffer
as much as I do.

173
00:18:21,960 --> 00:18:23,825
Speak Italian!

174
00:18:23,962 --> 00:18:27,830
I hate Italy! I hate the doctor!
And I hate your whores!

175
00:18:27,966 --> 00:18:30,935
How many of them were
you with tonight?

176
00:18:34,973 --> 00:18:37,840
- Have you gone crazy?
- Because I understand what you're saying?

177
00:18:37,976 --> 00:18:40,945
- No. And you don't understand me!
- [RUSSIAN]

178
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:50,000
- [RUSSIAN]
- [PROBABLY RUSSIAN]

179
00:18:50,989 --> 00:18:53,958
I'm the one who's going to
go sleep somewhere else.

180
00:19:27,960 --> 00:19:30,929
If you do exist, may you
be good to the good.

181
00:19:36,969 --> 00:19:40,928
I beg of you, give me that
dream that makes me so happy.

182
00:21:00,052 --> 00:21:01,952
But I was dreaming...

183
00:22:59,037 --> 00:23:01,005
Watch out!
Watch out!

184
00:23:04,976 --> 00:23:07,843
Curses!
I'm a klutz.

185
00:23:07,979 --> 00:23:11,847
- Would you excuse me?
- Me, excuse you?

186
00:23:11,983 --> 00:23:16,851
You may be a klutz,
but I'm cursed.

187
00:23:16,987 --> 00:23:18,956
Don't say that over a
couple of bruises.

188
00:23:20,992 --> 00:23:23,859
I just betrayed my
best friend.

189
00:23:23,995 --> 00:23:26,964
Want to know how?
Do you?

190
00:23:32,003 --> 00:23:33,868
No, it doesn't matter.

191
00:23:34,005 --> 00:23:37,873
- I don't want to know.
- I'll tell you. I'll tell you.

192
00:23:38,009 --> 00:23:40,978
I don't want to know.
Have a nice day.

193
00:23:51,022 --> 00:23:52,990
Marika!

194
00:24:01,967 --> 00:24:03,935
Marika, are you in the kitchen?
I hear you.

195
00:24:07,973 --> 00:24:09,941
I'm here.
I need to talk to you.

196
00:24:11,977 --> 00:24:14,844
In Italian, calmly.
In Italian.

197
00:24:14,980 --> 00:24:17,847
You were right.

198
00:24:17,983 --> 00:24:20,952
It turns out I am evil,
and my doctor's an ass.

199
00:24:22,988 --> 00:24:25,855
I remembered one
of my dreams.

200
00:24:25,991 --> 00:24:28,960
You don't need to be jealous.
It wasn't what you thought.

201
00:24:30,996 --> 00:24:32,964
It's worse.

202
00:24:35,000 --> 00:24:35,967
Marika.

203
00:24:40,005 --> 00:24:40,972
Marika?

204
00:24:46,011 --> 00:24:46,978
Marika?

205
00:24:56,021 --> 00:24:58,888
"I went back home. I went
back to Velingrad."

206
00:24:59,024 --> 00:25:03,825
Now that I've made up my mind,
I'm not angry anymore.

207
00:25:03,962 --> 00:25:07,830
But don't follow me.
Don't pursue me.

208
00:25:07,966 --> 00:25:11,925
We had some happy times,
many years ago.

209
00:25:19,978 --> 00:25:21,843
Good morning!

210
00:25:21,980 --> 00:25:23,845
Have you seen Felice?

211
00:25:23,982 --> 00:25:25,950
This morning?

212
00:25:49,007 --> 00:25:52,875
No, no, it doesn't matter.
Today you've got every right.

213
00:25:53,011 --> 00:25:54,876
What do you mean "today"?

214
00:25:55,013 --> 00:25:57,880
We knew it.
I knew it.

215
00:25:58,016 --> 00:25:59,881
What did you know?

216
00:26:00,018 --> 00:26:03,818
Did she write you a letter, too?

217
00:26:03,955 --> 00:26:06,822
Bad news travels, Felice.

218
00:26:06,958 --> 00:26:10,826
Besides, I almost saw it
coming. Didn't you?

219
00:26:10,962 --> 00:26:13,829
No.
And I'd rather not talk about it.

220
00:26:13,965 --> 00:26:17,924
Bring me a glass of rum? Thanks.

221
00:26:22,974 --> 00:26:25,841
My friend, what are you
talking about?

222
00:26:25,977 --> 00:26:28,844
I'd like to believe in
fate, like our parents...

223
00:26:28,980 --> 00:26:32,848
...would say, but he just
wanted to disappear for good.

224
00:26:32,984 --> 00:26:34,849
Who's this?

225
00:26:34,986 --> 00:26:38,854
I say that, but I don't
want to disrespect him.

226
00:26:38,990 --> 00:26:43,950
-Tobia. Tobia Rambaldi.
-Tobia, what?
-Tobia...

227
00:26:45,997 --> 00:26:47,862
Forgive me...

228
00:26:47,999 --> 00:26:51,867
Every time I speak of
the dead...

229
00:26:52,003 --> 00:26:53,971
...it makes me laugh.

230
00:27:00,011 --> 00:27:02,912
Don't take so many
sleeping pills.

231
00:27:04,949 --> 00:27:07,816
Don't shut the windows so tightly.

232
00:27:07,952 --> 00:27:11,911
If he'd only had a woman, or something...
He was so alone.

233
00:27:13,958 --> 00:27:16,927
Trust me. He killed himself.

234
00:27:27,972 --> 00:27:30,837
Gracias,
soy su hermana.

235
00:27:30,974 --> 00:27:32,841
My daughters, Tobia's nieces.

236
00:27:32,977 --> 00:27:35,946
Mom, the coffee's ready.

237
00:27:37,982 --> 00:27:40,849
You need to have something
in your stomach.

238
00:27:40,985 --> 00:27:43,954
We must go on.

239
00:28:00,004 --> 00:28:02,905
- And you?
- I already had some.

240
00:28:45,984 --> 00:28:47,952
Forgive me.

241
00:28:58,997 --> 00:29:01,795
I understand if
you don't forgive me.

242
00:29:01,933 --> 00:29:03,901
Do you want me to leave?

243
00:29:19,951 --> 00:29:22,818
You had the courage to say
"enough!"

244
00:29:22,954 --> 00:29:25,923
Marika left too.

245
00:29:28,960 --> 00:29:30,928
And I'm left alone.

246
00:29:33,965 --> 00:29:36,934
Tobia,
what are you doing now?

247
00:29:44,976 --> 00:29:45,943
He's... alive!

248
00:29:47,979 --> 00:29:48,946
He's alive!

249
00:29:51,983 --> 00:29:52,950
He's alive!

250
00:29:56,988 --> 00:29:59,855
It's the belly.
"Digestia mortis".

251
00:29:59,991 --> 00:30:02,858
It always happens
with the dead.

252
00:30:02,994 --> 00:30:05,963
Especially on a hot day.

253
00:30:11,002 --> 00:30:13,869
Not to me!
It won't happen to me!

254
00:30:14,005 --> 00:30:15,973
It won't happen to me!

255
00:30:27,018 --> 00:30:28,986
Here, take this.

256
00:30:31,022 --> 00:30:33,991
- Me?
- Tobia was happy.

257
00:30:39,030 --> 00:30:40,998
Goodbye, Rambaldi.

258
00:30:47,038 --> 00:30:48,903
See you soon, Tobia.

259
00:30:49,040 --> 00:30:51,008
Very soon.

260
00:31:30,014 --> 00:31:32,881
It's the last day
I'm coming to the office.

261
00:31:33,017 --> 00:31:36,885
I'm leaving too, but on a
longer trip that yours.

262
00:31:37,021 --> 00:31:39,888
Dear Marika, do not follow me.
Not by any means.

263
00:31:40,024 --> 00:31:42,891
I hope that, wherever you are...

264
00:31:43,027 --> 00:31:46,895
...you may once again live
with a man who makes you smile.

265
00:31:47,031 --> 00:31:48,896
Farewell, Marika,...

266
00:31:49,033 --> 00:31:52,992
...because that noctural
laughter frightens me too.

267
00:31:55,039 --> 00:31:59,908
At this moment I feel a
great desire to see the ocean.

268
00:32:00,044 --> 00:32:02,842
Tomorrow, I will take a
long bath...

269
00:32:02,981 --> 00:32:05,848
...a very long bath.

270
00:32:05,984 --> 00:32:08,851
Tobia, sitting before me...

271
00:32:08,987 --> 00:32:11,854
...you told me that it's
a good idea.

272
00:32:11,990 --> 00:32:13,855
Poor Rambaldi!

273
00:32:13,992 --> 00:32:18,861
- We'll end up crying.
- I couldn't sleep last night.

274
00:32:18,997 --> 00:32:22,865
He was such a meticulous
accountant.

275
00:32:23,001 --> 00:32:26,869
But as a man, you have to
admit, he was an imbecile.

276
00:32:27,005 --> 00:32:30,873
- How could you say that?
- I say it because the dead
don't scare me.

277
00:32:31,009 --> 00:32:33,876
He was an imbecile.
Think about it.

278
00:32:34,012 --> 00:32:37,880
When someone doesn't know what
to do with their own life...

279
00:32:38,016 --> 00:32:40,883
...and then decides to throw
it away, before doing it...

280
00:32:41,019 --> 00:32:43,886
The pleasures that I would
have had first!

281
00:32:44,022 --> 00:32:47,890
Is there a man than I hate?
I'd kill him first, and then myself.

282
00:32:48,026 --> 00:32:50,893
That's how you do it.
But he lacked courage.

283
00:32:51,029 --> 00:32:53,896
Who would Tobia have killed?

284
00:32:54,032 --> 00:32:57,900
Me, for example.
He hated me.

285
00:32:58,036 --> 00:33:00,903
And I didn't like him either.

286
00:33:01,039 --> 00:33:02,836
And not because of
his disability.

287
00:33:02,974 --> 00:33:05,841
How many times had he looked at me,
wishing he could kill me!

288
00:33:05,977 --> 00:33:07,842
Why didn't he do it?

289
00:33:07,979 --> 00:33:11,847
Poor Rambaldi, his death
was no use to anybody.

290
00:33:11,983 --> 00:33:14,952
He died an imbecile.

291
00:33:22,994 --> 00:33:26,862
- I live near here.
- We'll take you.

292
00:33:26,998 --> 00:33:29,967
I'd rather walk a little.

293
00:33:32,003 --> 00:33:34,972
- Goodnight, Leonora.
- Goodnight, Gino.

294
00:34:37,001 --> 00:34:38,969
Who's there?

295
00:34:54,018 --> 00:34:55,883
Tespini! Is that you?

296
00:34:56,020 --> 00:34:57,988
Did you know that you almost scared me?

297
00:35:05,963 --> 00:35:07,931
Did you come to tell me something?

298
00:35:09,967 --> 00:35:11,832
Yes. Something very serious.

299
00:35:11,969 --> 00:35:13,834
Serious?

300
00:35:13,971 --> 00:35:18,931
- Tomorrow, in the office.
- No, here, in your house.

301
00:35:24,982 --> 00:35:28,850
What do you want to tell me,
at this hour of the night?

302
00:35:28,986 --> 00:35:30,851
Does you know what you're doing?
Sit down!

303
00:35:30,988 --> 00:35:33,855
No, I prefer to stand.

304
00:35:35,993 --> 00:35:38,858
Tespini!
Is it loaded?

305
00:35:38,900 --> 00:35:41,000
It's loaded.

306
00:35:46,003 --> 00:35:48,870
Keep it in your pocket.
You were always very nervous.

307
00:35:49,006 --> 00:35:50,974
Sit down.

308
00:35:55,012 --> 00:35:56,980
Yes, I'll sit.

309
00:35:59,016 --> 00:36:00,984
I'm sitting.

310
00:36:04,956 --> 00:36:06,924
Now since...

311
00:36:08,960 --> 00:36:11,929
...I've decided to reunite
with Tobia Rambaldi,...

312
00:36:13,965 --> 00:36:16,832
- What do you mean?
- I mean that...

313
00:36:16,968 --> 00:36:19,937
...in a few hours,
by morning...

314
00:36:21,973 --> 00:36:23,838
...I'm going to kill myself.

315
00:36:23,975 --> 00:36:26,842
And I have to watch?

316
00:36:26,978 --> 00:36:31,847
There are certain things
I won't permit you to say.

317
00:36:31,983 --> 00:36:33,951
Permit me.

318
00:36:40,992 --> 00:36:44,951
Because before killing myself,
I'm going to kill you.

319
00:36:46,998 --> 00:36:49,865
I'm going to avenge an imbecile.

320
00:36:50,001 --> 00:36:51,969
Tobia.

321
00:36:54,005 --> 00:36:55,973
Rambaldi,
Tobia.

322
00:37:02,947 --> 00:37:04,812
You heard me on the stairs.

323
00:37:04,949 --> 00:37:06,917
It was a joke.

324
00:37:09,954 --> 00:37:11,922
I was joking!

325
00:37:13,958 --> 00:37:15,926
How stupid I was!

326
00:37:18,963 --> 00:37:20,931
Now I understand.

327
00:37:22,967 --> 00:37:24,832
You've shown me that.

328
00:37:24,969 --> 00:37:27,836
...to prove to me that
you have courage...

329
00:37:27,972 --> 00:37:30,941
...and to scare someone
like me.

330
00:37:32,977 --> 00:37:34,842
Bravo.

331
00:37:34,979 --> 00:37:36,947
You almost succeeded...

332
00:37:38,983 --> 00:37:41,850
...theatrical animal that you are.

333
00:37:41,986 --> 00:37:45,853
- Bass, right?
- Baritone.

334
00:37:45,989 --> 00:37:46,957
Applause.

335
00:37:48,993 --> 00:37:51,962
You'd better put those hands
together to pray.

336
00:37:57,001 --> 00:37:59,868
Stop! Stop!
Shut the door!

337
00:38:00,004 --> 00:38:01,904
Shut it!

338
00:38:07,945 --> 00:38:10,812
- You're crazy.
- Crazy? Do I seem crazy to you?

339
00:38:10,948 --> 00:38:12,813
Shut the other one, too.

340
00:38:12,950 --> 00:38:16,818
Now you call me crazy, but
didn't you say that Rambaldi was

341
00:38:16,954 --> 00:38:19,821
...an imbecile for not killing
you before killing himself?

342
00:38:19,957 --> 00:38:23,824
People like you are either
demented or imbeciles.

343
00:38:23,960 --> 00:38:24,928
Shut the other door too!

344
00:38:26,964 --> 00:38:30,832
Tomorrow, when people learn
of my suicide, I don't want...

345
00:38:30,968 --> 00:38:33,937
...you calling me an imbecile too.
I must kill you!

346
00:38:36,974 --> 00:38:39,943
Tobia, lend me a hand.

347
00:38:43,981 --> 00:38:46,950
No, it's fine.
I'm not running away.

348
00:38:48,986 --> 00:38:51,955
I just want to have a
glass of water.

349
00:39:16,947 --> 00:39:18,915
On your knees.

350
00:39:27,958 --> 00:39:29,926
Okay.

351
00:39:31,962 --> 00:39:33,827
I beg you...

352
00:39:33,964 --> 00:39:35,932
...not to do this.

353
00:39:39,970 --> 00:39:42,837
Calm down.
I'm not going to kill you.

354
00:39:42,973 --> 00:39:46,932
I don't believe that I'd
be an imbecile not to kill you.

355
00:39:48,979 --> 00:39:50,947
- Can I get up?
- No.

356
00:39:54,985 --> 00:39:57,852
If you knew how distant
you look to me...

357
00:39:57,988 --> 00:40:01,856
...you look so tiny to me,
cute, even.

358
00:40:01,992 --> 00:40:04,961
A poor little man,
with muscular legs.

359
00:40:06,997 --> 00:40:12,956
- Get up, sit down, and write.
- Really?

360
00:40:13,003 --> 00:40:14,971
What do I write?

361
00:40:20,010 --> 00:40:22,877
"I, Gino Migliori...

362
00:40:23,013 --> 00:40:25,880
confess and repent...

363
00:40:26,016 --> 00:40:31,977
I repent of having called
Tobia Rambaldi an imbecile...

364
00:40:34,024 --> 00:40:37,000
...for not having given himself
the pleasure of killing me...

365
00:40:37,010 --> 00:40:41,893
...his enemy, the one
who's writing this, before
committing suicide.

366
00:40:44,034 --> 00:40:46,901
- I write that?
- Yes.

367
00:40:47,037 --> 00:40:50,006
- "Felice Tespini..."
- Yes?

368
00:40:52,042 --> 00:40:53,907
"...before he killed himself...

369
00:40:54,044 --> 00:40:56,012
...came to visit me...

370
00:40:59,049 --> 00:41:03,952
...and told me that in order
to avoid being called an imbecile...

371
00:41:06,991 --> 00:41:08,959
...he had to kill me...

372
00:41:10,995 --> 00:41:13,964
He could have done it, but
he didn't...

373
00:41:16,000 --> 00:41:18,969
...because he showed mercy
towards my cowardice.

374
00:41:26,010 --> 00:41:28,877
It was enough for him
to declare...

375
00:41:29,013 --> 00:41:31,982
...that the real imbecile
was me...

376
00:41:34,018 --> 00:41:35,883
...Gino Migliori."

377
00:41:36,020 --> 00:41:38,989
Now sign it.

378
00:41:48,032 --> 00:41:49,897
What's the point of all this...

379
00:41:50,034 --> 00:41:52,901
...if you're still decided
on killing yourself?

380
00:41:53,037 --> 00:41:55,005
What's the point?

381
00:41:57,041 --> 00:42:01,000
They will find it tomorrow,
on the beach, in my pocket.

382
00:42:19,997 --> 00:42:22,864
Console yourself by reflecting
that mine...

383
00:42:23,000 --> 00:42:25,969
...will be a little more
difficult than yours.

384
00:42:49,026 --> 00:42:50,994
- Here you go.
- Thanks.

385
00:42:59,036 --> 00:43:01,004
Come here!

386
00:43:02,973 --> 00:43:05,840
Take it, it's a toy.

387
00:43:05,976 --> 00:43:08,843
Here, I'll give you the
cartridges too.

388
00:43:08,979 --> 00:43:10,947
Go! Go!

389
00:43:15,986 --> 00:43:18,853
- What's going on?
- Excuse me, are you free?

390
00:43:18,989 --> 00:43:20,856
- Yeah, I'm free.
- Take me to the sea.

391
00:43:20,857 --> 00:43:22,000
The sea's a big place. Where to?

392
00:43:22,000 --> 00:43:23,857
Wherever's closest.
And hurry.

393
00:43:23,994 --> 00:43:26,861
- This isn't a hearse.
- I know.

394
00:43:26,997 --> 00:43:28,965
- Take me away.
- Okay.

395
00:44:01,031 --> 00:44:03,932
Adieu, Tosca.
Adieu...

396
00:44:30,994 --> 00:44:34,862
Hey buddy, pick me up?
Come pick me up, eh?

397
00:44:34,998 --> 00:44:36,863
Sure, come here.

398
00:44:37,000 --> 00:44:38,865
Come with me.

399
00:44:39,002 --> 00:44:43,871
Climb aboard. We'll throw
ourselves into the sea, together.

400
00:44:44,007 --> 00:44:46,874
A hearse-load of desperate men.

401
00:44:47,010 --> 00:44:48,978
Climb aboard!

402
00:44:51,014 --> 00:44:54,500
Joy! Joy!
Life is beautiful!

403
00:44:54,600 --> 00:44:56,884
And we should not spoil
it with our presence.

404
00:44:57,020 --> 00:44:58,988
Joy!

405
00:46:00,017 --> 00:46:03,919
The great Felice! Is it you?
Is it really you?

406
00:46:05,956 --> 00:46:08,823
Have I changed that much?
Don't you recognize me?

407
00:46:08,959 --> 00:46:10,824
From the choir?

408
00:46:10,961 --> 00:46:14,228
- I was just a girl.
- Nora?
- Yes!

409
00:46:14,229 --> 00:46:15,932
Yes, Nora!

410
00:46:17,968 --> 00:46:20,835
You mysterious man!
What are you doing here?

411
00:46:20,971 --> 00:46:22,836
Just a little errand. And you?

412
00:46:22,973 --> 00:46:24,838
I'm singing!
I'm pretty good now.

413
00:46:24,975 --> 00:46:29,844
We're having a practice session,
out in the fresh air. Right over there!

414
00:46:29,980 --> 00:46:32,847
It's not the Verona Arena,
but the company makes it work.

415
00:46:32,983 --> 00:46:35,952
Come on over, I'm sure you
must know some of them.

416
00:46:48,999 --> 00:46:51,866
Tell me, you with the pale eyes,
lips, and nose...

417
00:46:52,002 --> 00:46:55,870
...as bad as you may feel,
I'll whisk you away.
If you have a migraine...

418
00:46:56,006 --> 00:46:58,873
...I'll cure you.
I'll cure you of everything.

419
00:46:59,009 --> 00:47:03,810
Nora, my errand is important.

420
00:47:04,947 --> 00:47:06,000
Not to me.

421
00:47:06,000 --> 00:47:10,818
We have two hours to enjoy
the sea by ourselves.

422
00:47:10,954 --> 00:47:12,922
Take my bag.

423
00:47:16,960 --> 00:47:18,825
You want to go swimming?

424
00:47:18,962 --> 00:47:20,827
I'll get one for you, too.

425
00:47:20,964 --> 00:47:23,933
I was planning on going
for a swim myself.

426
00:47:33,977 --> 00:47:36,946
Are you ready?
I'm waiting.

427
00:48:01,004 --> 00:48:02,904
One more hour.

428
00:48:06,944 --> 00:48:09,811
It's so cold!
It feels like October.

429
00:48:09,947 --> 00:48:11,915
Are you cold, too?

430
00:49:02,933 --> 00:49:04,901
Felice!

431
00:49:14,945 --> 00:49:16,913
Felice!

432
00:49:20,951 --> 00:49:24,910
Soon...
Soon...

433
00:49:27,958 --> 00:49:30,927
Were you not feeling well?
Or were you just holding your breath?

434
00:49:32,963 --> 00:49:34,828
Holding my breath.

435
00:49:34,965 --> 00:49:37,832
It's a childish thing,
but I don't believe you.

436
00:49:37,968 --> 00:49:39,833
The water's too cold for that.

437
00:49:39,970 --> 00:49:41,938
It's my fault,
let me make it right.

438
00:49:43,974 --> 00:49:45,942
It's on me.

439
00:49:47,978 --> 00:49:49,946
I should go.

440
00:50:30,020 --> 00:50:32,989
She's a very good
singer now, eh?

441
00:50:35,025 --> 00:50:36,993
Cheers!

442
00:51:50,033 --> 00:51:53,901
- Bravo!
- You're finally smiling!

443
00:51:54,037 --> 00:51:56,904
I hadn't laughed in such
a long time. Not in the daytime.

444
00:51:57,040 --> 00:51:59,907
Thanks to that crazy Rossini!
Meow!

445
00:52:00,043 --> 00:52:03,843
You want to come with me?
I'm headed back to Rome at 7:00.

446
00:52:03,980 --> 00:52:05,845
Do you want to come?
I'll give you a lift.

447
00:52:05,982 --> 00:52:07,950
Don't try to take him with you.

448
00:52:11,988 --> 00:52:15,856
You're going to be busy later
with that errand you mentioned.

449
00:52:15,992 --> 00:52:17,960
That's why I'm here.

450
00:52:19,996 --> 00:52:22,863
- You can't put it off?
- No, I can't.

451
00:52:22,999 --> 00:52:27,868
And now I'm going. I ate, I drank,
I heard you, Nora. Thank you.

452
00:52:28,004 --> 00:52:29,972
I'm going.

453
00:52:56,032 --> 00:52:59,001
Remember "L'Italiana in Algeri"?

454
00:53:01,037 --> 00:53:04,939
The finale of the second act?
You were magnificent.

455
00:53:07,978 --> 00:53:10,845
Three minutes of applause.
No, four.

456
00:53:10,981 --> 00:53:13,950
You'd seduced everybody.

457
00:53:18,989 --> 00:53:20,854
Including you?

458
00:53:20,991 --> 00:53:22,959
Yes.

459
00:53:27,998 --> 00:53:31,866
I never told you that I
was in love with you?

460
00:53:32,002 --> 00:53:33,970
No. You never told me.

461
00:53:41,011 --> 00:53:42,979
You never told me.

462
00:53:47,017 --> 00:53:49,986
What a shame.
Who knew?

463
00:53:52,022 --> 00:53:55,981
Why don't you sing?
In your deep voice?
It couldn't hurt!

464
00:53:58,028 --> 00:53:58,995
No.

465
00:54:27,991 --> 00:54:30,858
This headdress is such a
weight to bear...

466
00:54:30,994 --> 00:54:34,862
...and I am so entangled
in these robes.

467
00:54:34,998 --> 00:54:36,863
Who speaks to you...

468
00:54:37,000 --> 00:54:38,968
Sorry, sorry...

469
00:54:56,019 --> 00:54:58,886
This headdress weighs so
heavily on my head...

470
00:54:59,022 --> 00:55:02,822
...and I am so entangled
in these robes.

471
00:55:02,959 --> 00:55:06,827
He who tells you
of this party...

472
00:55:06,963 --> 00:55:10,831
...does not merit
your attention.

473
00:55:10,967 --> 00:55:13,834
I thank you, my lord...

474
00:55:13,970 --> 00:55:16,837
...for the honour you do me.

475
00:55:16,973 --> 00:55:23,936
I thank you, my lord,
for the honour that you do me.

476
00:55:27,984 --> 00:55:30,953
What are they doing?
What do they want?

477
00:55:33,990 --> 00:55:35,958
Pity me.

478
00:55:37,994 --> 00:55:39,859
Listen to me.

479
00:55:39,996 --> 00:55:42,863
Pity me.
Listen to me.

480
00:55:42,999 --> 00:55:45,968
I am possessed.
I am possessed.

481
00:55:51,007 --> 00:55:53,976
We have to think, here.

482
00:55:57,013 --> 00:55:59,982
We have to think, here.

483
00:56:01,951 --> 00:56:03,816
If I flee...

484
00:56:03,953 --> 00:56:05,921
...I shall be hung.

485
00:56:07,957 --> 00:56:09,925
And if I submit...

486
00:56:11,961 --> 00:56:15,829
...then it's my duty to
bring him the candlestick.

487
00:56:15,965 --> 00:56:20,834
Taddeo, what child is this?

488
00:56:20,970 --> 00:56:23,837
Taddeo, what child is this?

489
00:56:23,973 --> 00:56:27,932
You will be punished, Taddeo.
What should I do?

490
00:56:29,979 --> 00:56:32,948
What should I do?

491
00:56:34,984 --> 00:56:37,953
What should I do?

492
00:56:39,989 --> 00:56:42,856
Calm down, gentlemen.
I'm staying.

493
00:56:42,992 --> 00:56:45,961
I do not wish to displease you.

494
00:56:47,997 --> 00:56:50,864
Calm down, gentlemen!
I'm staying!

495
00:56:51,000 --> 00:56:53,867
I do not wish to displease you.

496
00:56:54,003 --> 00:56:57,871
Calm down! I'm staying.
Calm down! I'm staying.

497
00:56:58,007 --> 00:57:00,874
I do not wish to displease you.

498
00:57:01,010 --> 00:57:03,808
I do not wish to displease you.

499
00:57:03,947 --> 00:57:06,916
I do not wish to displease you.

500
00:57:26,970 --> 00:57:29,939
Such reverence!

501
00:57:31,975 --> 00:57:33,840
Such an honour!

502
00:57:33,977 --> 00:57:36,844
Thank you, my dear gentlemen!

503
00:57:36,980 --> 00:57:39,949
Do not trouble yourselves.

504
00:57:41,985 --> 00:57:44,852
I'll do everything I can.

505
00:57:44,988 --> 00:57:47,855
But I can't do anything more.

506
00:57:47,991 --> 00:57:50,858
Here comes my niece.

507
00:57:50,994 --> 00:57:53,963
I must present myself.

508
00:57:55,999 --> 00:57:57,967
Taddeo...

509
00:58:00,003 --> 00:58:02,904
It would have been better...

510
00:58:05,942 --> 00:58:08,911
...if you had sunk...

511
00:58:10,947 --> 00:58:15,814
...to the bottom of the sea.

512
00:58:15,950 --> 00:58:17,818
- Viva!
- Thank you!

513
00:58:17,954 --> 00:58:20,923
- Viva!
- Such an honour!

514
00:58:25,962 --> 00:58:28,829
Here comes my niece.

515
00:58:28,965 --> 00:58:31,832
Here comes my niece.

516
00:58:33,970 --> 00:58:36,837
Here comes my niece.
I must present myself.

517
00:58:36,973 --> 00:58:39,840
I must present myself.

518
00:58:39,976 --> 00:58:42,843
I must present myself.

519
00:58:42,979 --> 00:58:45,948
Present! Present! Present!

520
01:02:12,989 --> 01:02:14,957
Is that for me?

521
01:02:16,993 --> 01:02:20,861
- Your uncle is calling your friend.
- Giulio!

522
01:02:20,997 --> 01:02:24,865
- He asked for me?
- At school, they draw with a...

523
01:02:25,001 --> 01:02:27,868
...computer like this one.
You were the best at drawing...

524
01:02:28,004 --> 01:02:29,869
...and you're going to keep on
being the best.

525
01:02:30,006 --> 01:02:32,966
What's this?

526
01:02:32,967 --> 01:02:35,966
They told me that this diskette
explains everything.

527
01:02:37,013 --> 01:02:37,980
Ah, cool.

528
01:02:41,017 --> 01:02:42,882
- You're happy, eh?
- Yep.

529
01:02:43,019 --> 01:02:45,988
Tell your dad.

530
01:02:49,025 --> 01:02:51,994
Yes, of course.

531
01:02:59,035 --> 01:03:03,836
Vincenzo, do you think I'll
win the dance contest?

532
01:03:03,973 --> 01:03:05,941
Another night without dinner!

533
01:03:12,982 --> 01:03:16,850
Follow the lines of Giotto's
drawing with the pencil.

534
01:03:16,986 --> 01:03:21,946
Then remove it, and obtain the
graphical copy.

535
01:03:23,993 --> 01:03:25,961
Later...

536
01:03:33,002 --> 01:03:36,870
Why do they teach you to
draw trees like that?

537
01:03:37,006 --> 01:03:40,965
I like drawing people more, too.

538
01:03:42,011 --> 01:03:43,876
Look at this.

539
01:03:44,013 --> 01:03:48,882
They're strangers too.
The professor was right.

540
01:03:49,018 --> 01:03:52,886
He says that if you copy them
well enough...

541
01:03:53,022 --> 01:03:56,890
...then you end up really
knowing these men.

542
01:03:57,026 --> 01:04:00,894
All the lines in the drawing
converge at the centre...

543
01:04:01,030 --> 01:04:03,828
...where the betrayal takes
place. Come closer.

544
01:04:03,966 --> 01:04:08,835
Compare the face of Christ to
that of Judas...

545
01:04:08,971 --> 01:04:10,939
...the traitor.

546
01:04:28,991 --> 01:04:32,950
My father isn't a traitor.
He isn't Judas.

547
01:04:41,003 --> 01:04:43,870
SEBASTlANO CANGEMI:
ANOTHER CONFESSION?

548
01:04:44,006 --> 01:04:47,965
NO NEWS OF HIS SON'S
WHEREABOUTS

549
01:04:59,021 --> 01:05:00,989
Stop!

550
01:05:03,960 --> 01:05:06,827
- Go left.
- You want me to drive through
the city?

551
01:05:06,963 --> 01:05:08,931
Could you take a left?

552
01:05:18,975 --> 01:05:21,842
We'll move into a nice hotel.
Just the two of us.

553
01:05:21,978 --> 01:05:24,845
Your uncle wants you to
get a change of scenery.

554
01:05:24,981 --> 01:05:27,950
I've got a wonderful surprise
planned for you.

555
01:05:29,986 --> 01:05:31,954
Vincenzo...

556
01:05:38,995 --> 01:05:41,964
You see that?
Look, it's your sisters!

557
01:05:57,013 --> 01:05:58,981
Mommy!

558
01:06:13,963 --> 01:06:15,828
Be brave!

559
01:06:15,965 --> 01:06:18,832
Is this the appreciation I
get for surprising you?

560
01:06:18,968 --> 01:06:22,927
I showed you them so that
you could see that they're fine!
Everything's fine!

561
01:06:24,974 --> 01:06:26,942
Speed up!

562
01:07:12,955 --> 01:07:14,820
This is for us.

563
01:07:14,957 --> 01:07:18,825
- All of it?
- You can choose whichever ones you want.

564
01:07:18,961 --> 01:07:22,920
- That one, or that one, or that one...
- What if I want to use all of them?

565
01:07:28,971 --> 01:07:30,939
Bon appetit!

566
01:07:54,997 --> 01:07:56,965
How many do you want?

567
01:08:00,002 --> 01:08:02,903
- How many?
- Two!

568
01:08:06,942 --> 01:08:08,913
Goodnight, Rocco!

569
01:08:13,949 --> 01:08:16,918
Not with bare feet I can't!

570
01:08:18,954 --> 01:08:22,822
Come on, today we're playing
against Brazil!

571
01:08:22,958 --> 01:08:26,917
This is how Pelé got started,
when he was a boy. Let's play!

572
01:08:32,968 --> 01:08:36,836
- I play better with shoes!
- Shoes come later!

573
01:08:36,972 --> 01:08:39,839
You need to feel the ball
with your skin, that's how...

574
01:08:39,975 --> 01:08:42,842
...it gets in your blood.
Now pay attention! The ball!

575
01:08:42,978 --> 01:08:45,947
Let's go!
Let's go!

576
01:08:53,989 --> 01:08:55,854
Go away!

577
01:08:55,991 --> 01:08:58,858
Well I didn't have fun, either.

578
01:08:58,994 --> 01:09:01,895
We've got to have patience,
the two of us.

579
01:09:03,933 --> 01:09:05,901
It's just a matter of days.

580
01:09:07,937 --> 01:09:09,802
Don't you trust your dad?

581
01:09:09,939 --> 01:09:11,804
Him, you, and me...

582
01:09:11,941 --> 01:09:14,910
aren't we all a big family?

583
01:09:16,946 --> 01:09:18,914
Let's get back to playing.

584
01:09:27,957 --> 01:09:30,926
Without the 500 Liras, it doesn't work.

585
01:09:32,962 --> 01:09:34,930
Thanks.

586
01:09:42,972 --> 01:09:44,837
Look.

587
01:09:44,974 --> 01:09:48,842
Come on, look. You know what
that mountain is called?

588
01:09:48,978 --> 01:09:52,846
Ballaró.
You know who Ballaró was?

589
01:09:52,982 --> 01:09:54,847
An abductee, like you.

590
01:09:54,984 --> 01:09:57,851
It bears his name, because
he stayed on that mountain.

591
01:09:57,987 --> 01:10:00,956
He never went back home.

592
01:10:02,992 --> 01:10:04,857
But you...

593
01:10:04,994 --> 01:10:08,862
...you're at a great hotel.
You're an artist.

594
01:10:08,998 --> 01:10:10,863
I already told you.

595
01:10:11,000 --> 01:10:14,868
By summer, you and your
sister will be in Cefalú,...

596
01:10:15,004 --> 01:10:16,972
...cheering me on in a discotheque!

597
01:10:19,008 --> 01:10:22,876
- He never went back home?
- Never.

598
01:10:23,012 --> 01:10:26,880
You should know your history.

599
01:10:27,016 --> 01:10:28,984
I don't want to hear it.

600
01:10:32,021 --> 01:10:32,988
Let's play.

601
01:10:35,024 --> 01:10:37,891
Yes, with shoes.
With shoes!

602
01:10:38,027 --> 01:10:40,894
Let's go! Get the ball!
Throw it!

603
01:10:41,030 --> 01:10:42,998
Let's go!

604
01:11:25,007 --> 01:11:27,976
ONE HUNDRED YEARS AGO...

605
01:11:39,021 --> 01:11:40,886
Doctor Ballaró!

606
01:11:41,023 --> 01:11:42,991
Doctor Ballaró.

607
01:11:46,028 --> 01:11:47,996
On your knees.

608
01:11:52,034 --> 01:11:54,002
Are you trying to abduct me?

609
01:12:30,005 --> 01:12:33,873
- No screaming.
- Jesus Christ, a trap!
- Don't blaspheme!

610
01:12:34,009 --> 01:12:37,968
- Now we're in mortal danger!
- They're watching us!

611
01:12:47,022 --> 01:12:48,887
Damn it!

612
01:12:49,024 --> 01:12:50,889
I'm not moving from this spot.

613
01:12:51,026 --> 01:12:52,891
I am not moving from this spot!

614
01:12:53,028 --> 01:12:55,895
I can't do any more. I'm sick.

615
01:12:56,031 --> 01:12:59,000
I'm not moving from this spot.
I'm not moving from this spot.

616
01:13:16,985 --> 01:13:19,852
- Now be good, and write.
- How much do you want?

617
01:13:19,988 --> 01:13:23,856
- A thousand, at least.
- More! More!
- More, of course.

618
01:13:23,992 --> 01:13:25,857
But I don't have any cash.

619
01:13:25,994 --> 01:13:28,861
They'll have to sell their
land, their houses.

620
01:13:28,997 --> 01:13:31,864
If I say here,
what will do you?

621
01:13:32,000 --> 01:13:33,865
They'll borrow it.

622
01:13:34,002 --> 01:13:36,869
- Who will?
- Your mother and your sisters.

623
01:13:37,005 --> 01:13:39,872
My second wife, you mean.

624
01:13:40,008 --> 01:13:42,875
The sisters are hers, not mine.

625
01:13:43,011 --> 01:13:45,878
You messed up, boys.

626
01:13:46,014 --> 01:13:47,879
You messed up.

627
01:13:48,016 --> 01:13:51,884
- You messed up. You got it wrong,
my dear Mannuzzo.
- You recognized me?

628
01:13:52,020 --> 01:13:53,885
My boy...

629
01:13:54,022 --> 01:13:58,891
...you cover your face and
leave your hands uncovered...

630
01:13:59,027 --> 01:14:00,995
...hands that I treated, myself.

631
01:14:02,965 --> 01:14:05,832
Take off that handkerchief,
Mannuzzo.

632
01:14:05,968 --> 01:14:07,833
Look me in the eye.

633
01:14:07,970 --> 01:14:09,835
But how?

634
01:14:09,972 --> 01:14:11,940
How could you do this to me?

635
01:14:14,977 --> 01:14:18,845
Enough talk.
Behave yourself, or we kill you.

636
01:14:18,981 --> 01:14:23,941
You want me to behave?
You're the ones who should be
behaving yourselves!

637
01:14:25,988 --> 01:14:28,855
Come one, what am I supposed
to be writing with?

638
01:14:28,991 --> 01:14:31,858
- A pencil.
- You have one.

639
01:14:31,994 --> 01:14:35,862
- This isn't a pencil...
- Yes, it's a pencil.

640
01:14:35,998 --> 01:14:39,866
You guys don't even know
how to use a pencil.

641
01:14:40,002 --> 01:14:42,869
- What do you mean?
- I mean it needs to have a point!

642
01:14:43,005 --> 01:14:44,870
- Can you sharpen it?
- Yes.

643
01:14:45,007 --> 01:14:48,875
Like this, with the knife.
Sharpening it... with the knife.

644
01:14:49,011 --> 01:14:51,980
No knife!
Behave yourself!

645
01:14:56,018 --> 01:14:59,886
If you want me to write,
I'll write. But it won't matter.

646
01:15:00,022 --> 01:15:03,822
My wife and her sisters
won't respond.

647
01:15:03,959 --> 01:15:07,827
They'll just say they didn't
receive any letter. And... goodbye!

648
01:15:07,963 --> 01:15:10,830
They'd rather I die.

649
01:15:10,966 --> 01:15:13,833
They'd never have killed me.

650
01:15:13,969 --> 01:15:16,836
They were waiting for a miracle
from God...

651
01:15:16,972 --> 01:15:19,839
...sooner or later...

652
01:15:19,975 --> 01:15:22,842
...and that miracle's what
you boys are delivering.

653
01:15:22,978 --> 01:15:25,845
Just send me home. It's
the only solution.

654
01:15:25,981 --> 01:15:28,848
I'll bring you the money.
I know what you're thinking.

655
01:15:28,984 --> 01:15:31,851
"This guy's going to turn us
in, as soon as he gets free."

656
01:15:31,987 --> 01:15:34,854
But really, why should I spend
the little time I have...

657
01:15:34,990 --> 01:15:37,857
...looking over my shoulder
for your avenging relatives?

658
01:15:37,993 --> 01:15:39,858
Rotten wood.

659
01:15:39,995 --> 01:15:42,964
It's shit.

660
01:16:03,952 --> 01:16:05,920
Kill me here.

661
01:16:09,958 --> 01:16:12,825
Kill me here,
with my eyes open.

662
01:16:12,961 --> 01:16:15,828
Don't kill me in my sleep,
that's cowardly.

663
01:16:15,964 --> 01:16:17,829
You don't have any
other options.

664
01:16:17,966 --> 01:16:20,935
Doctor, get inside, or I'll
shoot you.

665
01:16:22,971 --> 01:16:23,938
Fillicó.

666
01:16:25,974 --> 01:16:28,943
Fillicó.
Fillicó.

667
01:16:30,979 --> 01:16:34,938
You're Fillicó?
I'm lost.

668
01:16:36,985 --> 01:16:41,945
I know you, you're a good man.

669
01:16:43,992 --> 01:16:46,859
A beast of burden. A man of integrity.

670
01:16:46,995 --> 01:16:48,963
A man of few words.

671
01:16:52,000 --> 01:16:54,969
How were they able to
strip you of your decency?

672
01:16:57,005 --> 01:16:58,870
How?
How?

673
01:16:59,007 --> 01:17:00,872
Get in, or I'll shoot you.

674
01:17:01,009 --> 01:17:04,809
As sure as the stars in the sky,
I'll shoot you.

675
01:17:04,946 --> 01:17:08,814
Where are these stars you see?
You're a beast.

676
01:17:08,950 --> 01:17:11,817
Beast!
You know nothing...

677
01:17:11,953 --> 01:17:15,821
...and you want to speak of
stars? What stars do you see?

678
01:17:15,957 --> 01:17:18,824
You see them, you think that
they're still there?

679
01:17:18,960 --> 01:17:21,827
You think they haven't
disappeared millions of years ago?

680
01:17:21,963 --> 01:17:23,828
They're dead.
Dead!

681
01:17:23,965 --> 01:17:26,832
If you know nothing about
the things that you see...

682
01:17:26,968 --> 01:17:29,937
...then with what right do
you keep me here?

683
01:17:32,974 --> 01:17:34,942
Let me go.

684
01:18:09,945 --> 01:18:12,812
I came here, sir...

685
01:18:12,948 --> 01:18:16,816
...to tell you that these
three boys of mine...

686
01:18:16,952 --> 01:18:20,820
...have made a mistake,
and repent of their errors.

687
01:18:20,956 --> 01:18:25,825
But they can't let you go.
Nor can they kill you.

688
01:18:25,961 --> 01:18:31,831
They will keep you here,
until God wills it otherwise.

689
01:18:31,967 --> 01:18:33,832
He shall forgive us.

690
01:18:33,969 --> 01:18:39,839
Great sacrifices are in store for you.
And for them as well.

691
01:18:39,975 --> 01:18:44,844
They have resigned themselves
to the punishment they have earned.

692
01:18:44,980 --> 01:18:49,849
Every day, they will bring you
bread and something you eat.

693
01:18:49,985 --> 01:18:53,853
One by one, they will stand
guard over you.

694
01:18:53,989 --> 01:18:56,856
And the other two will work for him.

695
01:18:56,992 --> 01:19:02,794
I brought you this wool coat,
for when it gets cold...

696
01:19:02,931 --> 01:19:05,900
...and this lamp, for when
it gets dark.

697
01:19:08,937 --> 01:19:12,805
The Fontevalle Tabernacle has two.

698
01:19:12,941 --> 01:19:16,809
Up here, we are all Christs
on the cross.

699
01:19:16,945 --> 01:19:18,810
I have to shit!

700
01:19:18,947 --> 01:19:23,907
And I have shit here, on my
feet, like an animal?

701
01:19:27,956 --> 01:19:30,925
Remove his chain.
Let's go.

702
01:19:41,970 --> 01:19:44,939
Come outside.
Come on, get out.

703
01:19:54,983 --> 01:19:57,850
In front of you all?

704
01:19:57,986 --> 01:20:00,955
Make yourself comfortable,
we'll turn around.

705
01:20:13,001 --> 01:20:14,866
I don't know if you were joking
the other night...

706
01:20:15,003 --> 01:20:17,870
...when I said that the stars
are both there and not there...

707
01:20:18,006 --> 01:20:20,975
...and that the eyes see
things that aren't there.

708
01:20:23,011 --> 01:20:26,970
They're not there anymore, Fillicó.
I wasn't joking.

709
01:20:29,017 --> 01:20:31,884
In order to reach us,
the light from those stars...

710
01:20:32,020 --> 01:20:34,887
...has to travel millions
of kilometers...

711
01:20:35,023 --> 01:20:36,888
...over millions of years.

712
01:20:37,025 --> 01:20:43,897
By the time their light has
reached us, the stars themselves
have disappeared from the universe.

713
01:20:44,032 --> 01:20:46,899
- That's how it is, Fillicó.
- What?

714
01:20:47,035 --> 01:20:49,902
Light runs, like a horse?

715
01:20:50,038 --> 01:20:52,905
At millions of kilometers a second.

716
01:20:53,041 --> 01:20:55,009
You're joking.

717
01:20:58,046 --> 01:21:01,948
I wasn't joking then,
and I'm not joking now.

718
01:21:03,985 --> 01:21:07,853
You played a joke on Fillicó.
Light doesn't travel.

719
01:21:07,989 --> 01:21:10,856
It's easy to play a joke on him.
He'll believe anything.

720
01:21:10,992 --> 01:21:14,860
The moon, the stars,
the Milky Way, the scorpions.

721
01:21:14,996 --> 01:21:16,861
They're all witchcraft.

722
01:21:16,998 --> 01:21:20,866
I'm like Saint Thomas.
I only believe in what I touch...

723
01:21:21,002 --> 01:21:22,970
...and in what I see.

724
01:21:27,008 --> 01:21:28,976
Come here.

725
01:21:36,017 --> 01:21:37,882
Your eyes...

726
01:21:38,019 --> 01:21:40,886
...what do they see over there?

727
01:21:41,022 --> 01:21:43,889
- The mountain, and the sky.
- What colour are they?

728
01:21:44,025 --> 01:21:45,890
White.

729
01:21:46,027 --> 01:21:48,996
And now what do you see?

730
01:21:52,033 --> 01:21:55,002
- The sky is green.
- Green.

731
01:22:02,978 --> 01:22:05,845
- And now?
- Red, like Hell.

732
01:22:05,981 --> 01:22:07,846
Red, like Hell.

733
01:22:07,983 --> 01:22:10,850
Your eyes, and mine...

734
01:22:10,986 --> 01:22:14,854
...are like a glass through
which we observe things.

735
01:22:14,990 --> 01:22:18,949
If their colours change, then
so do the things we see.

736
01:22:20,996 --> 01:22:22,861
Think about that.

737
01:22:22,998 --> 01:22:27,867
Things are not they way you're
used to seeing them...

738
01:22:28,003 --> 01:22:32,963
...but also the way you
want to see them, Mannuzzo.

739
01:22:35,010 --> 01:22:36,978
Think about that.

740
01:23:15,984 --> 01:23:19,852
Only animals like you
are ignorant that the earth...

741
01:23:19,988 --> 01:23:22,855
...spins like a top.
Around and around.

742
01:23:22,991 --> 01:23:26,859
Do you mean that, right now...

743
01:23:26,995 --> 01:23:31,864
...there are men standing upside
down, who don't fall into the sky?

744
01:23:32,000 --> 01:23:33,865
- Yes, sir.
- That's incredible!

745
01:23:34,002 --> 01:23:36,869
I don't believe it.

746
01:23:37,005 --> 01:23:40,873
Believe it, my boy.
You are glass...

747
01:23:41,009 --> 01:23:45,878
...glass that God has not yet blown.

748
01:23:46,014 --> 01:23:49,973
Why don't you try to blow me?

749
01:23:57,025 --> 01:23:58,890
Stand over there.

750
01:23:59,027 --> 01:24:00,892
You are this...

751
01:24:01,029 --> 01:24:04,829
...and this is the Earth.
Understand?

752
01:24:04,966 --> 01:24:08,834
The world spins quickly, like so.

753
01:24:08,970 --> 01:24:10,835
Around and around.

754
01:24:10,972 --> 01:24:13,839
- And you don't fall out.
- Doctor, are you trying to kill me?

755
01:24:13,975 --> 01:24:16,944
That's what Galileo said!
Galileo!

756
01:24:51,012 --> 01:24:52,877
Spinning around...

757
01:24:53,014 --> 01:24:54,982
...and around.

758
01:25:32,987 --> 01:25:34,852
A loaf of bread.

759
01:25:34,989 --> 01:25:38,948
Is this your little boy?
What's his name?

760
01:25:40,995 --> 01:25:42,963
Galileo.

761
01:25:44,999 --> 01:25:45,966
Galileo?

762
01:25:48,002 --> 01:25:49,970
Galileo.

763
01:25:52,006 --> 01:25:54,873
- How many children does Mannuzzo have?
- Three.

764
01:25:55,009 --> 01:25:58,877
- Three. And Chicché?
- Five.

765
01:25:59,013 --> 01:26:03,814
Poor Chicché!
Bring them to see me!

766
01:26:03,952 --> 01:26:06,921
I'd like to get to know them,
one of these Sundays.

767
01:26:08,957 --> 01:26:09,924
If I last long enough.

768
01:27:25,967 --> 01:27:29,926
- What happened?
- He's been like this all day.

769
01:27:42,984 --> 01:27:46,852
Leave him. Dr. Ballaró
is a good Christian...

770
01:27:46,988 --> 01:27:49,957
...but a difficult man
to understand.

771
01:28:39,974 --> 01:28:42,841
- It had to be red.
- What?

772
01:28:42,977 --> 01:28:45,842
- The handkerchief.
- Red? Why?

773
01:28:45,979 --> 01:28:47,846
- You're an animal.
- You put it on.

774
01:28:47,982 --> 01:28:50,849
Right, when we kidnapped him...

775
01:28:50,985 --> 01:28:53,954
...it was red.

776
01:29:20,948 --> 01:29:24,907
The kids want to play.
Let's go! Let's go!

777
01:31:41,022 --> 01:31:42,887
SEBASTIANO CANGEMI SPEAKS

778
01:31:43,024 --> 01:31:46,983
VINCENZO'S FATHER
COLLABORATES WITH THE JUSTICE DEPT.

779
01:32:28,002 --> 01:32:28,969
Right.

780
01:32:32,006 --> 01:32:32,973
Left.

781
01:32:36,010 --> 01:32:36,977
Right.

782
01:32:39,013 --> 01:32:39,980
Left.

783
01:32:42,016 --> 01:32:42,983
Right.

784
01:32:46,020 --> 01:32:46,987
Left.

785
01:32:52,026 --> 01:32:53,994
Right.

786
01:32:56,030 --> 01:32:57,998
Left.

787
01:33:01,035 --> 01:33:01,933
Right.

788
01:33:04,972 --> 01:33:05,939
Left.

789
01:37:08,949 --> 01:37:11,918
YOU LAUGH

790
01:37:13,000 --> 01:37:23,000
